Side Project bot for discord

The code is open source (clearly).

The bot is mostly to help moderate chat, all custom modules will be open source though.

In theory it should be possible to take the bot core, and create your own modules.

If you do want to make your own changes to the code don't bother attempting to contact me to help you, but if you want information
about how the bot works, then i may be willing to help.
