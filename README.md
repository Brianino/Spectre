# Spectre
Side Project bot for discord

The code is open source (clearly).

The bot is mostly to help moderate chat, all custom modules will be open source though.

In theory it should be possible to take the bot core, and create your own modules.

If you do want to make your own changes to the code don't bother attempting to contact me to help you, but if you want information
about how the bot works, then i may be willing to help.

# Config
owner: should be the id of the bot owner (this is for commands limited to the owner)
prefix: is the command prefix to use.
token: the bot token to login to the bot account.
login_retries: the number of retries is some sort of network error occurs when attempting to login.
